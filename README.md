# Neural-Image-Captioning
IE498JS  SP2020 Final Project: 

Automatically describing the content of an image is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence that connects computer vision and natural language processing. In this project, we present a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation and that can be used to generate natural sentences describing an image.
